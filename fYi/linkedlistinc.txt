linked list in C is a dynamic data structure that consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list. Here's a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C: [1]
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define the structure for a node
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

// Function to create a new node
struct Node* newNode(int data) {
    struct Node* node = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    node->data = data;
    node->next = NULL;
    return node;
}

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(struct Node* head) {
    struct Node* current = head;
    while (current != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", current->data);
        current = current->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // Create a simple linked list with three nodes
    struct Node* head = newNode(1);
    head->next = newNode(2);
    head->next->next = newNode(3);

    // Print the linked list
    printf("Linked list: ");
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

• Structure: The Node structure defines a node in the linked list. It contains the data and a pointer to the next node.
• newNode() function: This function creates a new node with the given data.
• printList() function: This function traverses the linked list and prints the data in each node.
• main() function: This function creates a simple linked list with three nodes and prints it. [1, 2, 3]

Important concepts:

• Head: The head pointer points to the first node in the list.
• Next: The next pointer in each node points to the next node in the list.
• NULL: The next pointer of the last node is set to NULL to indicate the end of the list. [1, 4, 5]

Common operations on linked lists:

• Insertion: Adding a new node to the list (at the beginning, end, or a specific position).
• Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
• Searching: Finding a specific node in the list.
• Traversal: Iterating through the list to access each node's data.
