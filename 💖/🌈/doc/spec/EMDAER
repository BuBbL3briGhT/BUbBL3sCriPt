Welcome to the the doc/spec directory.

All files herein are propsed to generate
into the test directory. Code in the test
directory (PROJECT_ROOT/test) are proposed
to be able to generate back into this
directory. An algorythm for detecting and
mergeing changes is proposed inorder to
simplyfy the process of development and
keeping erey ting uptadat.

Improved syntax highlighing for the combination
of sources will be greatly appreciated
for whole hearted adoption.

It would be possible to have Mocha run
tests from these specs directly, but
further integration would be required eg.
Mocha Interface.
